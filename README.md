# Robot Mates

FW repository for very simple line follower robot called Mates made from [m-BITBEAM](https://www.e-mole.cz/diy/m-bitbeam) ([Hackaday project](https://hackaday.io/project/158815-m-bitbeam-construction-set)) contruction set.

## Line Follower

FW demonstrates the basic line follower function using one line sensor.

## Molegraph

FW demonstrates using of [MoleGraph](https://www.e-mole.cz/diy/molegraph). MoleGraph is a desktop application acquiring and plotting data from Arduino. You can see a graph of samples from the line sensor. It could be useful for checking the line sensor threshold value.
